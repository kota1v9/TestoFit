    <h1>Common Myths & FAQs About Testosterone</h1>

    <p>Testosterone is one of the most misunderstood hormones. Whether you're trying to optimize it naturally or are curious about hormone health, there's a lot of misinformation out there. Let's bust some myths and answer some of the most frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Myth 1: Testosterone is only about sex drive and muscle</h2>
    <p>While testosterone does affect libido and muscle growth, it also plays major roles in mood regulation, red blood cell production, cognitive function, and fat distribution. <a href="testosterone-guide.html" class="inline-link">Read our full guide to testosterone</a> to understand its broader impact.</p>

    <h2>Myth 2: Supplements are useless for testosterone</h2>
    <p>Many supplements marketed as "testosterone boosters" are overhyped, but that doesn’t mean all supplements are useless. <a href="supplement-vitamin-d.html" class="inline-link">Vitamin D</a>, <a href="supplement-zinc.html" class="inline-link">zinc</a>, <a href="supplement-omega-3.html" class="inline-link">omega-3s</a>, and others have solid science behind them for supporting testosterone. Check out our <a href="articles.html" class="inline-link">supplement guides</a> to learn more.</p>

    <h2>Myth 3: High testosterone makes you aggressive</h2>
    <p>This myth has been exaggerated. While testosterone may increase confidence and competitiveness, it does not inherently cause aggression. In fact, low testosterone can be linked to irritability and depression. It's all about hormonal balance.</p>

    <h2>FAQ: What’s the best way to naturally increase testosterone?</h2>
    <p>Start with lifestyle: focus on strength training, <a href="fitness-routine-for-men.html" class="inline-link">consistent exercise routines</a>, better sleep, and stress management. <a href="lifestyle-hormone-health.html" class="inline-link">Learn how your lifestyle affects your hormones</a>.</p>

    <h2>FAQ: How do I know if my testosterone is low?</h2>
    <p>Common signs include low libido, fatigue, depression, reduced muscle mass, and trouble focusing. If you suspect low testosterone, consult with a medical professional and request a blood test for confirmation.</p>

    <h2>FAQ: Is TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) safe?</h2>
    <p>When medically prescribed and monitored, TRT can be safe and effective. However, it's not the first line of defense for everyone. Many people see results with lifestyle and supplement changes before ever needing TRT.</p>
