    <h1>Common Myths & FAQs About Testosterone</h1>
    <p>Testosterone is a critical hormone in both men and women, but there’s a lot of misinformation surrounding it. This page clears up common myths and answers the most frequently asked questions to help you make informed decisions.</p>

    <h2>Myth 1: More Testosterone Always Means More Muscle</h2>
    <p>While testosterone supports muscle growth, more isn’t always better. There's a natural limit to how much muscle your body can build — and past a certain point, excess testosterone can lead to negative side effects. Focus on optimizing healthy levels, not chasing extreme doses.</p>

    <h2>Myth 2: Only Older Men Need to Worry About Low T</h2>
    <p>Although testosterone naturally declines with age, many younger men experience low levels due to poor sleep, chronic stress, excessive alcohol, poor diet, or lack of exercise. Hormone health should be a priority at every age.</p>

    <h2>Myth 3: Supplements Are a Waste of Money</h2>
    <p>There are definitely ineffective products out there — but some supplements are backed by real science. For example, zinc, vitamin D, and omega-3s all support hormone production when used correctly. You just need to choose the right ones and use them consistently.</p>

    <h2>Myth 4: Testosterone Boosters Are Dangerous</h2>
    <p>Natural testosterone boosters that use vitamins, minerals, and adaptogens are generally safe when used properly. Problems arise when people use unregulated compounds or abuse synthetic hormones. Always choose trusted, proven supplements — and when in doubt, consult a doctor.</p>

    <h2>FAQ: What’s a Normal Testosterone Level?</h2>
    <p>For men, normal total testosterone levels typically fall between 300–1,000 ng/dL. For women, it's 15–70 ng/dL. However, symptoms matter more than numbers — always interpret lab results alongside how you feel and perform.</p>

    <h2>FAQ: Do I Need a Blood Test?</h2>
    <p>Yes. A blood test is the only way to confirm your testosterone levels and check for imbalances. It’s smart to get tested if you're experiencing fatigue, low libido, mood swings, or muscle loss. Many clinics and home labs now offer affordable options.</p>

    <h2>FAQ: Can Lifestyle Really Boost Testosterone?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely. Regular resistance training, quality sleep, nutrient-rich foods, stress management, and proper supplementation can significantly improve testosterone levels — even without medical treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Don’t believe everything you read online. Stick to science-backed information, monitor your body, and take a well-rounded approach to hormone health.</p>
