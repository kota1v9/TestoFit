    <h1>Lifestyle & Hormone Health</h1>

    <p>Hormone levels — especially testosterone — are highly influenced by lifestyle choices. While food and supplements are important, how you sleep, manage stress, and structure your day plays a massive role in maintaining optimal levels. Let’s dive into some of the most important habits and how to apply them.</p>

    <h2>Sleep Optimization</h2>
    <p>Getting 7–9 hours of quality sleep every night is non-negotiable for hormone health. Sleep is when your body releases the majority of its testosterone. Skipping rest, having irregular sleep cycles, or staying up too late all suppress testosterone production. Try using blackout curtains, limiting blue light before bed, and going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.</p>

    <h2>Track Your Health</h2>
    <p>It’s hard to improve what you don’t track. Monitoring your weight, sleep, and other vital signs can give you insight into your overall health, fitness progress, and testosterone-boosting efforts. Smart scales can track trends in weight, body fat, and even muscle mass.</p>

    <h2>Stay Hydrated and Fuel Wisely</h2>
    <p>Proper hydration and protein intake are vital for healthy hormones and muscle recovery. Shaker bottles make it easy to stay on top of your hydration and protein goals whether you're at home, work, or the gym. Keep a few clean ones on rotation for convenience.</p>

    <h2>Supplement Smart with Creatine</h2>
    <p>Creatine is one of the most researched and effective supplements available. It helps improve strength, endurance, muscle size, and overall energy. While it doesn’t directly raise testosterone, it enhances performance and recovery — which supports a testosterone-friendly lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Limit Alcohol and Junk Food</h2>
    <p>Alcohol, processed food, and sugar all wreak havoc on your endocrine system. They can lead to increased estrogen levels, weight gain, and liver dysfunction, which negatively affects testosterone. Swap them for whole foods, filtered water, and nutrient-rich snacks like nuts, fruit, or yogurt.</p>

    <h2>Manage Stress Daily</h2>
    <p>Chronic stress increases cortisol — the stress hormone that directly suppresses testosterone. Managing your stress through deep breathing, meditation, daily exercise, or journaling helps keep cortisol in check and your hormones optimized.</p>

    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Hormone health is about consistency, not perfection. Start implementing one habit at a time and build from there.</p>
